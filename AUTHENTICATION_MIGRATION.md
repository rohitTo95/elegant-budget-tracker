# Authentication Migration: Cookie-based to localStorage-based

## Summary of Changes Made

### Backend Changes:

1. **Removed Cookie Dependencies:**
   - Removed `cookieParser` import and middleware from `server.ts`
   - Updated CORS to `credentials: false`
   - Removed cookie setting in login endpoints (both `server.ts` and `src/routes/auth.ts`)
   - Simplified logout endpoints to not clear cookies

2. **Updated Middleware (`src/middleware/jwt/authenticateToken.ts`):**
   - Removed cookie token reading logic
   - Now only reads tokens from `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`)

3. **Updated CORS Configuration:**
   - Set `credentials: false` since we no longer send cookies
   - Maintained `Authorization` header in `allowedHeaders`

### Frontend Changes:

1. **Updated Axios Configuration (`src/lib/axios.ts`):**
   - Set `withCredentials: false`
   - Added request interceptor to automatically add `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from localStorage
   - Updated response interceptor to clear localStorage on auth failures

2. **Updated AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
   - **Login:** Now stores JWT token in localStorage after successful login
   - **Logout:** Removes token from localStorage
   - **checkAuth:** Checks for token existence in localStorage before making API calls

3. **Updated Logout Hook (`src/hooks/use-logout.ts`):**
   - Explicitly removes token from localStorage on logout

## How the New Authentication Flow Works:

### Login Process:
1. User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token in response body
3. Frontend stores token in `localStorage.setItem('token', token)`
4. Frontend updates authentication state

### Request Authentication:
1. Axios request interceptor automatically reads token from localStorage
2. Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all requests
3. Backend middleware validates token from Authorization header

### Logout Process:
1. Frontend calls `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
2. Frontend removes token from localStorage
3. Frontend clears authentication state

### Authentication Check:
1. On app load, AuthContext checks if token exists in localStorage
2. If token exists, makes request to `/api/auth/check` with token in header
3. Backend validates token and returns user info
4. Frontend updates authentication state based on response

## Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Simpler CORS:** No need for `credentials: true` or complex cookie policies
2. **Cross-Domain Friendly:** Works better across different domains/ports
3. **Explicit Token Management:** Frontend has full control over token storage
4. **Better for Production:** No issues with cookie security settings

## Testing the Changes:

1. **Backend Test:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm run dev:server
   ```

2. **Frontend Test:**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Try logging in - token should be stored in localStorage
   - Check browser dev tools → Application → Local Storage
   - Verify protected routes work with the token
   - Test logout - token should be removed from localStorage

## Verification Commands:

Check if token is being sent in requests:
- Open browser dev tools → Network tab
- Look for `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in API requests

Check localStorage:
- Browser dev tools → Application → Local Storage
- Look for `token` key with JWT value
